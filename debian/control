Description: powerful, text based window manager and shell multiplexer
 Byobu is Ubuntu's text-based window manager based on GNU Screen.
 Using Byobu, you can quickly create and move between different windows
 over a single SSH connection or TTY terminal, monitor dozens of important
 statistics about your system, detach and reattach to sessions later
 while your programs continue to run in the background.
