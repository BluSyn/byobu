.SH NAME
byobu \- wrapper script for seeding a user's byobu configuration and launching a text based window manager (either screen or tmux)

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbyobu\fP [screen options]

\fBbyobu\-screen\fP [screen options]

\fBbyobu\-tmux\fP [tmux options]

Options to \fBbyobu\fP are simply passed through \fBscreen\fP(1) or \fBtmux\fP(1).

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbyobu\fP is a script that launches a text based window manager (either \fBscreen\fP(1) or \fBtmux\fP(1)) in the byobu configuration.  This enables the display of system information and status notifications within two lines at the bottom of the screen session. It also enables multiple tabbed terminal sessions, accessible through simple keystrokes.

\fBbyobu\fP currently defaults to using \fBtmux\fP(1) (if present) as the backend, however, this can be overriden with the \fBbyobu-select-backend\fP(1) utility.

Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/byobu\fP if defined, and \fI$HOME/.byobu\fP otherwise.

.SH BACKGROUND COLORS
The background colors of the \fBbyobu\fP status lines can be adjusted by editing the files \fI$HOME/.byobu/color\fP (for \fBbyobu\-screen\fP) and \fI$HOME/.byobu/color.tmux\fP (for \fBbyobu\-tmux\fP).  The command \fBCtrl-Shift-F5\fP will change the background to a randomly selected color when running in \fBbyobu\-tmux\fP mode.  Simply remove those files to return to the default color configuration.

.SH STATUS NOTIFICATIONS

\fBbyobu\fP supports a number of unique and interesting status notifications across the lowest two lines in the screen.  Each status notification item is independently configurable, enabled and disabled by the configuration utility.  The guide below helps identify each status item (in alphabetical order):

\fBapport\fP \- symbol displayed if there are pending crash reports; {!} symbol displayed on the lower bar toward the left, in black on an orange background

\fBarch\fP \- system architecture; displayed on the lower bar toward the left, in the default text color on the default background color

\fBbattery\fP \- battery information; display on the lower bar toward the right; \- indicates discharging, + indicates charging, = indicates fully charged;  when charging or discharging, the current battery capacity as a percentage is displayed;  the colours green, yellow, and red are used to give further indication of the battery's charge state; you may override the detected battery by setting BATTERY=/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0 in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\fP

\fBcpu_count\fP \- the number of cpu's or cores on the system; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in the default text color on the default background, followed by a trailing 'x'

\fBcpu_freq\fP \- the current frequency of the cpu in GHz; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in white text on a light blue background

\fBcpu_temp\fP \- the cpu temperature in Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit, configure TEMP=F or TEMP=C in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\fP; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in yellow text on a black background; you may override the detected cpu temperature device by setting MONITORED_TEMP=/proc/acpi/whatever in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\fP

\fBcustom\fP \- user defined custom scripts; must be executable programs of any kind in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/bin\fP; must be named N_NAME, where N is the frequency in seconds to refresh the status indicator, and NAME is the name of the script; N should not be less than 5 seconds; the script should echo a small amount of text to standard out, standard error is discarded; the indicator will be displayed in the lower panel, in inverted colors to your current background/foreground scheme, unless you manually specify the colors in your script's output; BEWARE, cpu-intensive custom scripts may impact your overall system performance and could upset your system administrator!

.SH SESSIONS

Byobu name screen sessions "byobu", if unspecified.  To hide sessions from \fBbyobu-select-session\fP(1), prepend a "." to the beginning of the session name, like:

 byobu \-S .hidden

.SH WINDOWS

Each open window in the screen session is displayed in the upper bar toward the far left.  These are numbered, and include indicators as to activity in the window (see "activity" in \fBscreen\fP(1) for symbol definitions).  The current active window is highlighted by inverting the background/text from the rest of the window bar.

Users can create a list of windows to launch at startup in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows\fP.  This file is the same syntax as \fI~/.screenrc\fP, each line specifying a window using the "screen" command, as described in \fBscreen\fP(1).

User can also launch Byobu with unique window sets.  Users can store these as \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.[NAME]\fP, and launch Byobu with the environment variable \fBBYOBU_WINDOWS\fP.

For example:
  $ cat $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.ssh_sessions
  screen \-t localhost bash
  screen \-t aussie ssh root@aussie
  screen \-t beagle ssh root@beagle
  screen \-t collie ssh root@collie
  $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=ssh_sessions byobu

.SH UNITS OF MEASURE
byobu uses binary for capacity measurements of KB, MB, GB, and TB.  This means multiples of 1024 rather than multiples of 1000, in accordance with JEDEC Standard 100B.01 for disk and memory capacity measurements.  See:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards

byobu uses decimal for measurements of network data transfer, meaning multiple of 1000, rather than 1024.  See:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units

.SH KEYBINDINGS

byobu keybindings can be user defined in /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/ (or within .screenrc if byobu-export was used). The common key bindings are:

\fBF2\fP \- Create a new window

\fBF3\fP \- Move to previous window

\fBF4\fP \- Move to next window

\fBF5\fP \- Reload profile

\fBF6\fP \- Detach from this session

\fBF7\fP \- Enter copy/scrollback mode

\fBF8\fP \- Re-title a window

\fBF9\fP \- Configuration Menu

\fBF12\fP \-  Lock this terminal

\fBshift-F2\fP \- Split the screen horizontally

\fBctrl-F2\fP \- Split the screen vertically

\fBshift-F3\fP \- Shift the focus to the previous split region

\fBshift-F4\fP \- Shift the focus to the next split region

\fBshift-F5\fP \- Join all splits

\fBctrl-F6\fP \- Remove this split

\fBctrl-F5\fP \- Reconnect GPG and SSH sockets

\fBshift-F6\fP \- Detach, but do not logout

\fBalt-pgup\fP \- Enter scrollback mode

\fBalt-pgdn\fP \- Enter scrollback mode

\fBCtrl-a $\fP \- show detailed status

\fBCtrl-a R\fP \- Reload profile

\fBCtrl-a !\fP \- Toggle key bindings on and off

\fBCtrl-a k\fP \- Kill the current window

\fBCtrl-a ~\fP \- Save the current window's scrollback buffer

.SH "SCROLLBACK, COPY, PASTE MODES"

Each window in Byobu has up to 10,000 lines of scrollback history, which you can enter and navigate using the \fBalt-pgup\fP and \fBalt-pgdn\fP keys.  Exit this scrollback mode by hitting \fBenter\fP.  You can also easily copy and paste text from scrollback mode.  To do so, enter scrollback using \fBalt-pgup\fP or \fBalt-pgdn\fP, press the \fBspacebar\fP to start highlighting text, use \fBup/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn\fP to select the text, and press \fBenter\fP to copy the text.  You can then paste the text using \fBalt-insert\fP or \fBctrl-a-]\fP.

.SH "BUGS"

For Byobu colors to work properly, older versions of GNU Screen require a 1-line patch to adjust MAX_WINMSG_REND in screen.c.  The change is in GNU Screen's upstream source control system as of 2010-01-26, but GNU Screen has not released a new upstream version in several years.  You can disable colors entirely by setting MONOCHROME=1 in \fI$BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\fP.  For more information, see:
 * http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22146

PuTTY users have reported that the F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape sequences as the linux console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY config, Terminal -> Keyboard -> Function keys: Xterm R6.  See: \fIhttp://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html\fP

Apple Mac OSX terminal users have reported 'flashing text'.  You can fix this in the advanced settings of the terminal application, with 'Declare Terminal As: xterm-color'.

Apple Mac keyboard users may need to specify a vt100 terminal by adding this to your OSX profile, in order to get Byobu's function keys and colors to work:
  alias ssh='TERM=vt100 ssh'

Users of a non-UTF-8 locale (such as cs_CZ charset ISO-8859-2), may need to add "defutf8 off" to \fI~/.screenrc\fP, if some characters are rendering as "?".

Users who customize their PS1 prompt need to put this setting in \fI~/.bashrc\fP, rather than \fI~/.profile\fP, in order for it to work correctly with Byobu.

If you run \fBbyobu\fP(1) under \fBsudo\fP(8), you \fBmust\fP use the -H option, such that the user's $HOME directory environment variable is set properly.  Otherwise, \fBbyobu\fP(1) will create a bunch of directories in the $SUDO_USER's $HOME, but will be owned by root.  To prevent this from happening, \fBbyobu\fP(1) will simply refuse to run if $USER does not own $HOME.

Byobu requires a suitable \fBulimit\fP(3) values to run.  If you get an error at startup saying, 'pipe: too many open files', then check your ulimit -a values, as your "open files" or "max user processes" are too low.  In this case, you will probably need to run simple \fBscreen\fP(1)
